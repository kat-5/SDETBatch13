Types of variables in java:

We have 3 types of variables

local
instance
static


Local variables occupy the memory for shortest period of time

Access modifiers:
There are 3 access modifiers keywords(private, protected, public) and four access levels
(private, protected, public,default)


Rules:
Can only be used with instance variables and static members of a class(fields and methods)

private:
when we use private with a ny method or variable we can only access that method of variable in that class


Default (it's not a keyword)
we can access that member inside the same class inside the same package in other classes.

Public:
when we use the public access modifier with members of a class it is available thought
that project.

Real Life use:
99% of the time instance fields are always private.
99 % of the time instance and static methods are always private.

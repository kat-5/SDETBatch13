What is a Constructor in Java:
A constructor is a special block of code that helps us give initial values to the fields of a class, Initialization of
object or instance.

Why we should use a Constructor.

1) When we use the constructor to initialize the object it looks more readable and cleaner.
2) If the fields of a class are private is not possible to access them outside of a class without constructor ot a method
which means we can't initialize them without a method or a constructor.
3) We can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to a variable with the help of a constructor.
4)If we want to make sure that some lines of code should always be executed when the oj=bjcet of a class is created
 we can put that code inside the constructor


How to use Constructor
We create constructors inside the class and when an object of that class is created the constructor
is executed automatically.

call Car{
String make;
String model;

Car (String carMake, String carModel){
make=carMake;
model=carModel;
}

public static void main(String[] args){
Car bmw=new Car("BMW","m4");
}
}

Rules:
1) Constructors don't have return types not even void.
2) The name of the constructor should always be same as name of the class.
3) Constructors can't be created with a static keyword.
4) We can use any access modifiers with constructor.
5) If we don't write a constructor in a class a default constructor with zero
  parameters is created by compiler(compiler takes the code taken by us and converts
  that code to byte code wich is earier for java to understand).
6) It is not allowed to have two constructors in a class with same number of parameterds and same type

Inheretance is a mechanism in java through which we can get the properties and methods
and methods from the Parents class inside the child class

Why we should use inheritance:

Inheretance helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write for exampleif there are some properties and methods which are present in may different classes we can create a parent class for all those properties and can put the common properties or methids inside that parent class and make children class extebd from the parrernt class.

How can we use inheratance:
1-Create a parent class
2-put all the common methods an d properties from children classes inside that parent class
3-use extends keywork to inheret from that parent class

Rules:
1- Private foelds and private methods cant be inhereted inside the children classes
2- Constructors are also not inherited.

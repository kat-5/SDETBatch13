What is Polymorphism:

What is Abstraction:

   Abstraction  is providing only the necessary details and hiding all implementation details.


Why should we learn abstraction:
   1) It reduced the code complexity by separating the idea from implementation.
   2) It helps us enforce rules and convey our requirements.

How can we use Abstraction:

   1) Create classes with abstract keyword.
   2) use the abstract keyword with method header and don't provide the body of that method inside the
     parent class.
   3) Create the child classes and extend those classes from the parent class and imnplement the abstraction
    method.
   4)  If we don't want to provide the implementation of one of more methods we can declare the child class as
   abstract as well.

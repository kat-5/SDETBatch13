Rules:

1- Method names should be the same but different parameters
2- we cant overload a method by just changing its return type
3- We can also overload constructors by following the same rules.


Method Overriding:

Happens when same method exists inside the parent class and the child class.

Why we should override a method:
    If we are inheriting from a Parents class and we don't like the implementation of
    a method from a parent class we can provide our own implementation
    Sometimes is done to improve the performance of the code.


    How can we override a method:
    when we inherit from a class wqe sjut need to rewrite that method inside the child class,
     all should be same except the body and access modifier.

    Rules:

    1- For override we must inherit from a class
    2- The method in the parent class that we want to override must be exactly the same
    as method in the child class only the access modifiers can be different
    3- The access modifiers in the child class can only be increased with respect to the
    visibility for example we can change default to protect of to public but
    we cant make it private
    4- if something is not inhereted we cant override it for example private methods and constructors

method signature= method name + parameters

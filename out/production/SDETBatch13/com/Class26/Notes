what is an interface:
    interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields inside a class are public
    static final(constants) and all the methods by default are also public.
Why we should learn about the interfaces:
    We can implement abstraction using interfaces.
    when class are logically connected to each other and we want to have instance fields and implemented
    methods as well while doing abstraction then we should go with abstract class.
How can i use an interface:
    we use interface keyword instead of a class and we can start creating abstract methods

Rules:
    1)All the fields inside an interface are public static and final.
    2) No instance fields means no constructor is required.
    3) No instance methods in an interface and all the methods by default are abstract.
    4) when we implement the methods from the interface we use implements  keyword.
    5) Multiple inheritance is supported by interfaces in java.
    6) An interface can extend another interface.
    7) variables in interfaces can't be private protected or default.

What is Encapsulation in java:
   Encapsulation is 4th pillar of OOPs.it is a mechanism that provides us security. if we use encapsulation we can have more security.
How we should use Encapsulation:
    1) make your variables as private.
    2) Create setter and getter methods to read and write these fields.

Basic  unit to store data is a variable:
Its easy to acceess the value by variable name we don't need to concern about indexes

Problems with variables:

1- they can only store one value at a time.
2-If we have to store more than one value using variables we have to declare more variables

Arrays:

Arrays can hold multiple values in a single variable we then use indexes to access those values.


Upside of Arrays:
1)Arrays ar4 the fastest data structure when it comes to process the data.
2)Arrays ocuppy 4 times less memory than arrayList.

problems with Arrays:
1) They are fixed in size, once we create array cant modify size
2) No built-in methods in arrays like add, remove, findIndex etc.

To solve problems from Arrays we created Array list:

add()-- We use it to add the elements to an arrayList
remove()--

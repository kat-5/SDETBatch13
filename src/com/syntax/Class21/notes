What is super keyword:
Super keyword in java is used to refer to the parent class object.

Why should we learn super keyword.
1- If we have same name variable of method in the super/parent/base class then
we can use the super keyword to refer to parent class variable or method because by
default java prefers the variables of child class. We can also call the super class constructor
with the help of super with parenthesis super();

How to use super keyword:

1- We can use super. method name of field name to call the method or toacees the field of superclass

2- use the super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor.

Rules:

1- We can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method with the help of super keyword

2- we can only use super() inside a constructor.

3-  if we have a user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor
inside the child classes as well.

4- super() should be the first line inside of a constructor

5- if we have multimple constructors inside of the parent as soon as one is matches we are
good to go.

Very very Important to know before selenium:

Arrays
Loops
If else conditions
classes objects
methods
string class
string manipulation

What is method overloading:

When the same method exists in a class but with different number of parameters or
different type of parameters or different sequence of parameters it is called
 methodOverloading.

 Why we should use Method Overloading:
 1-Makes your code more readable
 2- Makes the life of the end users easy, they dont have to memorize many different method names.

 How we can use methodOverloading.
 we can have same name methods but we have to follow the below rules.
1- by passing different number of parameters
2- we can change the datatype of parameters
3- we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters
